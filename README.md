# Image_classification_520
Image classification using different models and compare their accuracies.
We have used 3 different models naive bayes, knn and perceptron to classify the images. There are two datasets of face and digits and the models are used to predict with different split on training and testing datasets. This helped us to estimate the minimum percentage of data split into training to have reasonable accuracy of atleast 70%. Upon changing a few things and feature modification the accuracy further goes upto 85% as well.
